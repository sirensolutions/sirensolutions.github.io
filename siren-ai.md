# Siren AI Plugin
The Siren AI plugin integrates Investigate with various LLM providers enabling users to leverage large language models (LLM) within their Investigate environment.

This plugin offers the following features:

* Generate comprehensive reports by analyzing user-created graphs.

* Extends the Siren API scripting environment by providing a set of methods for interacting programmatically with a configured LLM. This allows for the customization of UIs and workflows that integrate generative AI.

The supported LLM providers are OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama, and AWS Bedrock. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.siren.io/siren-ai/1.0/siren-ai/c_introduction.html) to learn more about this plugin.
