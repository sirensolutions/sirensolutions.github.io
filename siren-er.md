# Siren Entity Resolution

Entity resolution is the artificial intelligence / machine learning ability to recognize that two or more records (in the same or in separate tables and datasources) are in fact talking about the same entity (person, company, thing).


Use Siren Entity Resolution (ER) ability to find missing links in combination with Siren link analysis (graph browser) capabilities to explore previously unidentified connections and much more.


Siren ER can be used:

* in conjunction with Siren’s own ETL process (Data Reflections).  We provide a recipe for this method comprised of “transformation scripts” to use in several “data reflections” tasks pushing data to and from the Siren ER component.

* as an API as part of your own existing extract-transformation-load (ETL) process. In this case you can simply refer to the API documentation.

Siren ER is available in the free Siren Community Edition for up to to 10k records. To integrate Siren ER with Siren Investigate contact us.
